- [ ] Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a Swift app stemming from the NASA API. 
- [ ] The app must have a landing screen and 2 main areas. 
- [ ] The app MUST make use of UICollectionViews, ScrollViews, Animation, Unit Testing, and Error Handling. 
- [ ] We expect you to use different skills in different ways and invite you to go above and beyond the requirements stated in terms of usage of APIs and iOS capabilities. 
- [ ] This is a chance to make a really nice portfolio piece, and we hope you make it your own! 
- [ ] While mock-ups are provided, these represent just one possible way the finished app could look, so we hope you will get creative and base your layouts and design on the particular functionalities of your app.

## Rover Postcard Maker: 
- [ ] Access the Mars Rover Imagery API and display a selected, filtered, or randomized image from the Mars Rover. 
- [ ] You should also build functionality such that a user can add text over the image and then flatten the new image and send via a pre-populated email.

## Eye-In-the-Sky: 
- [ ] You will build a tool to access the Earth Imagery API. 
- [ ] Users should be able to, at a minimum, query the most recent photo of a particular location on earth. 
- [ ] In addition, you may not simply enter latitude and longitudes manually, but must input location information based on an interactive map, importing from contacts, OR another API, such as Foursquare.

## Third option: 
- [ ] You can absolutely create your own app feature, but must make material use of the NASA API and skills learned in the course, plus at least one skill/API/language feature NOT explicitly covered in the Techdegree thus far.
